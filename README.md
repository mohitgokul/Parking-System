# Parking-System

##
1.	Designed a Parking Lot using stack to keep track of the number of cars and number of empty spaces. 
2.	Developed a scalable design by using hash maps to keep track of the cars already present in the parking lot.

## HashMap
HashMap is a basic implementation of a Map interface in some of the Programming languages. The data is stored in (Key,Value) format. By using the key one can access the value. It basically uses the technique of hashing where a large string is converted into a small string which represents the same string. 

#### Constructors in HashMap
1. HashMap() : Creates a default HashMap with initial capacity 16 and load factor 0.75.
2. HashMap(int initial capacity) : Creates a HashMap instance with specified initial capacity 
3. HashMap(int initial capacity, float loadFactor) : Creates a HashMap instance with specified initial capacity and specified load factor.
4. HashMap(Map map) : Creates instance of HashMapwith same mappings as specified map.
